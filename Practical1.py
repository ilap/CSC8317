print '''O, then, I see Queen Mab has paid you a visit.
She is the fairy responsible for dreaming, assuming a shape
No bigger than an image engraved on a stone in the ring
On the index finger of a politician,
Drawn (in her chariot) by a team of creatures as tiny as atoms
Across the noses of men as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes are made of long spiders' legs,
The cover is made of grasshoppers' wings,
The harness is made of the smallest spider's web,
The collars (around their necks) are made of thin moonbeams,
Her whip is made of a cricket's bone, the lash is made of film,
Her charioteer is a small grey mosquito,
Not even as big as a parasite
Pulled off the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the carpenter squirrel or old worm,
(Who have been) the fairies' coach-makers since time began.
And with this splendour she gallops night after night
Through the brains of lovers, and then they dream of love;
Over the knees of courtiers, that dream on bowing to gain favour at Court,
Over the fingers of lawyers, who immediately dream of fees,
Over the lips of ladies, who immediately dream of kisses,
Who the angry Mab often plagues with blisters,
Because they have eaten candied fruit to sweeten their breath:
Sometimes she gallops over the nose of a courtier,
And then he dreams of some promotion within the Court;
And sometimes she comes with the tail of a pig intended to pay the Church,
Tickling a minister's nose as he lies asleep,
And then he dreams of another way to increase his income:
Sometimes she drives over the neck of a soldier,
And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambushes, the finest swords (thought to be Spanish),
Of toasting friends with overflowing cups; and then right away
He hears drums in his ear (for battle), which startles and wakes him,
And, being frightened, he says a hollow prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That tangles the manes of horses in the night,
And plasters on bloody knots in the hair of sluttish women,
The untangling of which brings much misfortune (either the ire of Mab or possibly infection):
This is the hag, who, when virgins lie on their backs,
Pushes on them and teaches them to stand the act (of intercourse),
Making them able to bear the load (of their husbands' weight).'''
